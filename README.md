# New Relic super agent

Our agent combines the power of existing New Relic capabilities with open standards technologies. The super agent is designed to be lightweight and efficient, and it can be configured to collect a wide range of data, including metrics, traces, logs, and events. 
The agent has a modular architecture, with a generic supervisor that is responsible for orchestrating the configured agents. It also integrates with New Relic fleet manager.

## Getting started

## Sample default static config (./config.yaml)

```yaml
opamp:
  endpoint: https://opamp.service.newrelic.com/v1/opamp
  headers:
    api-key: API_KEY_HERE

agents:
  nr_infra_agent:
    agent_type: "newrelic/com.newrelic.infrastructure_agent:0.0.1"
  nr_otel_collector:
    agent_type: "newrelic/io.opentelemetry.collector:0.0.1"
````

## Development

### Compile and run locally
1. Install [RUST](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Run `cargo build`
3. Binary will be placed at `./target/debug/newrelic-super-agent`
4. Prepare a `config.yaml` file in the current folder
5. Prepare folder for autogenerated configs at `/var/lib/newrelic-super-agent/auto-generated`
   * `sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/newrelic-super-agent/auto-generated`
6. Place values files in the folder `/etc/newrelic-super-agent/agents.d/{AGENT_ID}/` where AGENT_ID is a key in `agent:` list
7. Execute the binary with the config `sudo ./target/debug/newrelic-super-agent --config ./config.yaml`

### Running New Relic Super Agent Locally in Kubernetes

We use [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) and [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) to launch a local cluster and deploy the Super Agent [charts](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts).

#### Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have kubectl installed and properly configured.
- Install Minikube for local Kubernetes cluster emulation.
- Ensure you have Tilt installed for managing local development environments.

#### Steps
```
make tilt-up
```
This will spin up the Super Agent within your local Minikube Kubernetes cluster. You can view the Super Agent logs and services using Tilt's web interface or using standard kubectl commands.
